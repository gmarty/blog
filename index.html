<p>I gave it a try at drawing myself VR landscapes. It turns out VR textures are a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis">anamorphosis</a>. Some artists like Dali drew such projections. To reconstitute a normal image, you need a special device, in our case a VR environment.</p>
<h2><a name="what-i-learnt" class="anchor" href="#what-i-learnt"><span class="header-link"></span></a>What I learnt</h2>
<p>VR is an immersive technology. To feel yourself part of a VR landscape, we apply a texture to the sky (see the <code>&lt;a-sky&gt;</code> element in A-Frame). A texture is a simple image that is distorted to the inside of a sphere.</p>
<p>Drawing a landscape for such a projection is really counter-intuitive, but here are some of my findings.</p>
<h2><a name="equirectangular-projection" class="anchor" href="#equirectangular-projection"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Equirectangular projection</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with drawing your own landscapes for VR is to start with a image (or paper, canvas...) twice as large than high (once scanned, 4096 Ã— 2048 works pretty well).</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular projection</a>, the top line of the image is distorted in such a way that it&#39;s merged in a single point. The same apply to the bottom. This means that the closer to the top or bottom an object is the smaller it will be rendered in the VR scene. its width will be squeezed.</p>
<p>The left and right sides of the image are merged together. To make it feel seamless, be sure to draw something that looks the same on both lateral sides or stitch lines may appear.</p>
<p><img src="http://gu.illau.me/img/posts/landscapes-in-virtual-reality/ratio.jpg" alt="The ideal ratio for a VR landscape texture"></p>
<h2><a name="the-horizon-line" class="anchor" href="#the-horizon-line"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The horizon line</h2>
<p>If you draw a horizontal line right in the middle of the image, this is going to be rendered as your horizon line when you place the camera in the centre of the sphere.</p>
<p>You can play with it. Make it slightly higher and the user will feel that they&#39;re trapped in the group (or maybe surrounded by mountains), making the final result a bit suffocating.</p>
<p>If you lower the horizon line, the user will think they&#39;re flying.</p>
<p><img src="http://gu.illau.me/img/posts/landscapes-in-virtual-reality/horizon-line.jpg" alt="The horizon line in VR"></p>
<h2><a name="4-sides" class="anchor" href="#4-sides"><span class="header-link"></span></a>4 sides</h2>
<p>Your field of view fits in roughly 1/4 of the image width. If you draw a single element larger than 1/4 of the width, it will force the user to look left and right to see it entirely, without being able to see it completely at once.</p>
<p>Be creative with it. Big elements like monuments or mountains should be larger than 1/4 of the width. Smaller elements like vehicles or trees should be much smaller.</p>
<p><img src="http://gu.illau.me/img/posts/landscapes-in-virtual-reality/4-sides.jpg" alt="The 4 sides of the user"></p>
<h2><a name="sphere-in-the-sky" class="anchor" href="#sphere-in-the-sky"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Sphere in the sky</h2>
<p>As explained above, the equirectangular projection will merge the top of the image to a single point. If you want to draw a circular object right above the user, draw a stripe going from the top of the image on a small fraction of the height. This will render as a perfect circle if the line is parallel to the top of the image.</p>
<p>Of course this principle applies to the bottom of the image too.</p>
<p><img src="http://gu.illau.me/img/posts/landscapes-in-virtual-reality/sun.jpg" alt="Drawing a sun in a virtual reality environment"></p>
<h2><a name="the-result" class="anchor" href="#the-result"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The result</h2>
<p>I uploaded my experiments. On your mobile, go to:
<a href="https://gmarty.github.io/vr-landscapes/">gmarty.github.io/vr-landscapes/</a>
Grab a Google Cardboard and insert your phone. You can change the landscape with the click button.</p>
<p><img src="http://gu.illau.me/img/posts/landscapes-in-virtual-reality/drawings.jpg" alt="My drawings"></p>
<p>Drawing for an equirectangular projection leads to results that are hard to predict. Another technique is to draw on the 6 sides of a cube and use a software to turn this cubic texture into an equirectangular projection, but I haven&#39;t tried myself.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a go, you can reuse the <a href="https://github.com/gmarty/vr-landscapes">code on Github</a>. Just replace the images by yours. Then, share your creations and ideas in the comments section below.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You can build a voice assistant in JavaScript with existing open source libraries but the result sucks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last couple of days, I explored the voice in the browser. Here are my findings.</p>
<h2><a name="whats-available" class="anchor" href="#whats-available"><span class="header-link"></span></a>What&#39;s available</h2>
<p>Most of the voice related libraries in  JavaScript that I found are simple wrappers around the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html">Web Speech API</a>. Under the hood browsers use external services so I ruled out these libraries immediately as I wanted something that works offline.</p>
<p>What I found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js">pocketsphinx.js</a> for voice recognition</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/speak.js/">speak.js</a> for voice synthesis (several forks available)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these projects are brought to the web thanks to Emscripten and asm.js.</p>
<h2><a name="building-a-not-so-intelligent-voice-assistant" class="anchor" href="#building-a-not-so-intelligent-voice-assistant"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Building a (not so) intelligent voice assistant</h2>
<p>Thanks to a discussion with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/oncletom">Thomas</a> this weekend, <a href="http://cenode.io/">CENode.js</a> was brought to my attention. It&#39;s an open source project to enable human-machine conversation based on a human-friendly format. It can be used to simulate intelligence.</p>
<p>I had all the elements at hand to build a browser-based, offline voice assistant (Think Siri, OK Google, Amazon Echo...).</p>
<h2><a name="coding-or-rather-gluing" class="anchor" href="#coding-or-rather-gluing"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Coding (or rather gluing)</h2>
<p>Gluing all parts together was unsurprisingly easy. Pocketsphinx.js calls a function when the web worker has a final hypothesis:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onmessage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hyp</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">final</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">gotHypothesis</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hyp</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>I can feed this hypothesis to CENode.js by creating a new card:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">gotHypothesis</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hypothesis</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">card</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;there is a nl card named &#39;{uid}&#39; that is to the agent &#39;agent1&#39; and is from the individual &#39;User&#39; and has the timestamp &#39;{now}&#39; as timestamp and has &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">hypothesis</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/&#39;/g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\\&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39; as content.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">node</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add_sentence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">card</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Then I just have to wait until the deck is polled for new cards to my attention (my name is <code>User</code>). The new card contains the answer to my request and I can just do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">card</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>speak</code> will call <code>espeak.synth()</code> of speak.js.</p>
<h2><a name="adding-a-grammar" class="anchor" href="#adding-a-grammar"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Adding a grammar</h2>
<p>This is it for the JavaScript code. But an important part is still missing. Pocketsphinx.js needs to be fed with a grammar and the pronunciation of all the words used in the grammar. This is used to reduce the scope of detected phrases. So I&#39;ll conveniently reuse all the possible requests supported by CENode.js.</p>
<p>Considering the <a href="http://cenode.io/demo/">CENode.js demo</a> about astronomy, here&#39;s a list of some requests that it can understand (let me know if I missed any):</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">orbits</span> <span class="nx">Mars</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">does</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">Saturn</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">star</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">List</span> <span class="nx">instances</span> <span class="nx">of</span> <span class="nx">type</span> <span class="nx">planet</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The first step is to compute all the possible permutations that make sense in English and that CENode.js will understand. I found 124 of them. This is the corpus I&#39;ll use in the next steps.</p>
<p>The grammar used by pocketsphinx.js is a Finite State Grammar. Think of a finite state machine where each state adds a word to the phrase:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="c1">// s is the state with initial value 0.</span>

<span class="p">[]</span>    <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">What</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">does</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">Titan</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>    <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>     <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>     <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>      <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The grammar for this simple phrase is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">grammar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">numStates</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="nx">transitions</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>

  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The more phrases you add, the more complex it gets. For each state, pocketsphinx.js uses the grammar to figure out what is a possible next step. If your grammar is correct, you cannot end up with meaningless sentences.</p>
<p>I wrote a small script to build grammars from a corpus of phrases that I may publish if anyone is interested.</p>
<h2><a name="adding-pronunciation" class="anchor" href="#adding-pronunciation"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Adding pronunciation</h2>
<p>For each word in the corpus, pocketsphinx.js needs to know how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>I fed my corpus to <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html">Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool</a>. I simply took the <code>*.dic</code> file from the gz archive, split it on line breaks and split again each line on tabs and I got something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">wordList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;WHAT&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;W AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;WHAT(2)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;HH W AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;ORBIT&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;AO R B AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;MARS&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;M AA R Z&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="the-result" class="anchor" href="#the-result"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The result</h2>
<p>Et voila ! That&#39;s all I needed to get an astronomy centred voice assistant that can tell me what satellites orbit around what planets and other detailed infos. I have to say it&#39;s pretty cool, specially because I&#39;m a big fan of astronomy and I got this project done in under 2 days.</p>
<p>As a side note I tested it only on Firefox Nightly on my laptop. Results may differ on Chrome or on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The result though is not really convincing. First of all pocketsphinx.js voice recognition is bad. I can probably blame it on  my accent (I&#39;m French, remember), but it&#39;s so frustrating to say &quot;What orbits Saturn?&quot; hundreds of time with no results while my colleague got understood at the first try! The good thing at least is it can&#39;t return phrases out of the grammar, so it will always output something that makes sense.</p>
<p>CENode.js is also super limited and I don&#39;t really know how to improve it beyond the example provided (the format is well documented though). Some simple phrases, outside of the understanding scope, fail miserably:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">orbited</span> <span class="nx">by</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span><span class="o">?</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="nx">fails</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">does</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>    <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="nx">succeeds</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>But if you ask &quot;What is Saturn?&quot;, you get:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">Saturn</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">planet</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="nx">Saturn</span> <span class="nx">orbits</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">star</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sun&#39;</span> <span class="nx">and</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">orbited</span> <span class="nx">by</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">moon</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Titan&#39;</span><span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The passive voice does not seem to be supported in requests.</p>
<p>Finally, what is output by speak.js is pretty terrifying. Whatever the voice you choose, they all sound robotic. They have a cool retro feeling if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after (and you can argue that it works better for something related to astronomy and space), but they&#39;re far from the quality of commercial products.</p>
<h2><a name="going-further" class="anchor" href="#going-further"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Going further</h2>
<p>This experimentation was limited in time so I didn&#39;t want to spend too much on it, but if I had had a real project to build, I&#39;d had seriously looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding better language packages for pocketsphinx.js.</li>
<li>Building better grammar files for pocketsphinx.js.</li>
<li>Using CENode.js&#39; advanced features.</li>
<li>Using better voice packages in espeak.js.</li>
<li>Supporting more languages outside of English</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth sharing the code that&#39;s messy and I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader, unless somebody is really interested.</p>
<p>What I can share though is the FSG generator from a corpus. It needs some cleaning but the code can run on node or in the browser.</p>
<p>There&#39;s probably tons of mistakes and approximations in this post, I&#39;m by no means a voice expert, so please correct me if need be. Also if you have any ideas on how to improve it or if I missed an existing library, please do let me know in the comments. Thanks!</p>

As a test case, I generated a Welsh keyboard, as it is one of the few languages I know a little that didn&#39;t have a keyboard in Firefox OS (<a href="http://gu.illau.me/posts/japanese-keyboard-for-firefox-os/">Japanese keyboard</a> is another exception though). Typing on a mobile is hard enough, so word suggestions and autocorrect are keys for a better experience.
If you speak Welsh, even a little, and use Firefox OS on the master branch, please help us to test the keyboard and assess its quality.</p>

<p>Make sure you are using the latest version of B2G. If your device is a Flame or a Sony Z3C running Firefox OS, then you should get new updates automatically. Otherwise, you&#39;ll want to flash the latest version.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick demo of how to install it on your device.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWlPnWrX7AE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2><a name="test-the-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#test-the-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Test the keyboard</h2>
<p>The dictionary builtin in the keyboard is based on <a href="https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafan">Wikipedia in Welsh</a>, which has, I believe, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">decent number of pages</a> (around 64,000 articles, ranking it 64th biggest language out of 290).</p>
<p>From my experience, the results is very satisfying. I found the words suggested by this keyboard very useful. But my knowledge of Welsh is very limited, so it may not be completely helpful to a fluent speaker (or writer rather). In particular, I&#39;m afraid that it may be too formal or lack slang or colloquial expressions, frequently used in SMS or social networks.</p>

<p>If you speak Welsh, please, try it for yourself. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback and if you have any comments, please use the field below, or reach me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/g_marty">@g_marty</a>. If this method is proved to give good results, I&#39;d love to give it a go at producing dictionary in more languages.</p>
<p><em>Diolch!</em></p>

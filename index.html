As a test case, I generated a Welsh keyboard, as it is one of the few languages I know a little that didn&#39;t have a keyboard in Firefox OS (<a href="http://gu.illau.me/posts/japanese-keyboard-for-firefox-os/">Japanese keyboard</a> is another exception though). Typing on a mobile is hard enough, so word suggestions and autocorrect are keys for a better experience.
If you speak Welsh, even a little, and use Firefox OS on the master branch, please help us to test the keyboard and assess its quality.</p>
<h2><a name="install-and-activate-the-welsh-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#install-and-activate-the-welsh-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Install and activate the Welsh keyboard</h2>
<p>Make sure you are using the latest version of B2G. If your device is a Flame or a Sony Z3C running Firefox OS, then you should get new updates automatically. Otherwise, you&#39;ll want to flash the latest version.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick demo of how to install it on your device.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWlPnWrX7AE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2><a name="test-the-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#test-the-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Test the keyboard</h2>
<p>The dictionary builtin in the keyboard is based on <a href="https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafan">Wikipedia in Welsh</a>, which has, I believe, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">decent number of pages</a> (around 64,000 articles, ranking it 64th biggest language out of 290).</p>
<p>From my experience, the results is very satisfying. I found the words suggested by this keyboard very useful. But my knowledge of Welsh is very limited, so it may not be completely helpful to a fluent speaker (or writer rather). In particular, I&#39;m afraid that it may be too formal or lack slang or colloquial expressions, frequently used in SMS or social networks.</p>
<h2><a name="we-need-you" class="anchor" href="#we-need-you"><span class="header-link"></span></a>We need you!</h2>
<p>If you speak Welsh, please, try it for yourself. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback and if you have any comments, please use the field below, or reach me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/g_marty">@g_marty</a>. If this method is proved to give good results, I&#39;d love to give it a go at producing dictionary in more languages.</p>
<p><em>Diolch!</em></p>

<p><strong>tldr:</strong> You can&#39;t efficiently type in Japanese on a Firefox OS device, unless you buy a fx0 device or you build Gaia yourself and are very patient!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firefox OS is targeting a global audience. You can set your interface in 90 different languages and there are over 70 language specific keyboards!
But developing a keyboard is more challenging for some languages than others and Japanese is one of them.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t give much details about why is a Japanese IME hard to implement, but the main reason is that there is a massive amount of  suggestions that need to be stored on the device somehow. In Japanese, any word can be usually written in several different ways. Storing such a dictionary can cause serious issues on low-end devices with limited memory and processing power.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not a reason to just giving up typing in Japanese on Firefox OS.</p>
<h2><a name="fx0" class="anchor" href="#fx0"><span class="header-link"></span></a>fx0</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, KDDI released the <a href="http://au-fx.kddi.com/products/">fx0</a>, a Firefox OS powered device, on the Japanese market. This phone comes with a Japanese keyboard called <a href="http://www.omronsoft.co.jp/product_text/iwnn-ime-for-firefox-os/">iWnn IME</a> and developed by Omron Software.</p>
<p>The implementation is efficient and powerful. It comes with many options to configure the keyboard to perfectly suit your needs and habits. Such a high quality is not really surprising as the same keyboard is already available on other platforms (Android notably).</p>
<p>This keyboard has been open sourced in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-japan/iwnn-ime-sample">iwnn-ime-sample</a> Github repo. However the licence is expiring on 30th September 2015 (not sure what&#39;s happening afterwards).</p>
<p>The readme file claims it&#39;s possible to flash it on a Flame running Firefox OS v2.0. So I tried and everything is working, except for the core feature: the words suggestion. To achieve this in an optimised way, a local server running on the device is used to query words. This part doesn&#39;t work. The keyboard however can still be used to input kana, but you won&#39;t get any word suggestions.</p>
<p>I then flashed it on a master (tried both on a Flame and Sony Z3C). I encountered the same issue with the words suggestion together with other few minor bugs. But if you use it as a kana only keyboard, then this is probably acceptable.</p>
<p>Drop me a comment below if you need help on how to install it.</p>

<h2><a name="gaia-jp-kanji-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#gaia-jp-kanji-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Gaia <code>jp-kanji</code> keyboard</h2>
<p>There is already a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/keyboard/js/imes/jskanji">Japanese keyboard in Gaia</a>. To install it, you must build Gaia yourself and flash your device. Here is the suggested command line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ GAIA_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS</span><span class="o">=</span>en,jp-kanji make reset-gaia
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Once flashed, you must enable the new keyboard in <code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Keyboards</code>  &gt; <code>Select keyboards</code>.</p>
<p>This IME comes with words suggestion, but it is neither as user-friendly nor as fast as the iWnn IME one.
That is the reason why it is not available to current builds. I love how the design fits in the Firefox OS UI though.</p>
<p>There are plans to build a better Japanese keyboard for Firefox OS, but nothing has happened yet.</p>

<p>So unfortunately, there is no easy way to install a Japanese keyboard on Firefox OS, but we&#39;re working on it!
If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m doing with my device, I use the iWnn IME keyboard, but because of its limitations, I avoid typing in Japanese on my mobile whenever I can :-)</p>

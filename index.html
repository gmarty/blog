In this post I gathered some tips based on my experience organisation meetups in the last few years.</p>
<h2><a name="finding-speakers" class="anchor" href="#finding-speakers"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Finding speakers</h2>
<p>Probably the most tricky part of organising meetups, specially when you get started.</p>
<p>Make sure to leverage your network. Some of your friends, colleagues, Twitter followers may not have considered giving a talk before. Give them a chance!</p>
<p>If you struggle to find speakers, you can be creative and maybe ask a remote speaker to speak through Skype or similar. There are also other things you can do like hands-on sessions, lightning talks or discussion panels.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed giving under-represented people (students...) a platform to talk, to foster a culture of diversity. I even hard-coded this principle in the rule of conduct of the last meetup I organised.</p>
<h2><a name="getting-a-venue" class="anchor" href="#getting-a-venue"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Getting a venue</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re in London and your meetup aligns somehow with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/mission/">Mozilla mission</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/about/manifesto/">manifesto</a>, why not hold it at Mozilla office? You&#39;ll need to have an employee to sponsor you and make the requests on your behalf.</p>
<p>For other places or other topics I unfortunately don&#39;t have much experience, but you can try to contact the venues where you have attended meetups in the past. Here again, use your network!</p>
<h2><a name="drink-and-snack-sponsoring" class="anchor" href="#drink-and-snack-sponsoring"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Drink and snack sponsoring</h2>
<p>it&#39;s nice if possible to offer snacks and drinks to provide the attendees with the best experience possible. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t have much experience in finding sponsor but you can try to contact hiring companies in industries closely related to your meetup. They&#39;ll be happy to sponsor your event in exchange of a way to get in touch with local talents and potential users.</p>
<p>Another possibility depending on the number of attendees is to buy and bring snacks and drinks for yourself. Some big meetups don&#39;t offer such amenities so don&#39;t feel bad if you don&#39;t.</p>
<h2><a name="av" class="anchor" href="#av"><span class="header-link"></span></a>AV</h2>
<p>Do you need any specific Audio/Video support? Some venues can accommodate all sorts of A/V needs (recording, live streaming...). At the very least you&#39;ll need an internet connection and a monitor to show slides and demos. Make sure you know your needs and clear any assumptions with both the speakers and the venue beforehand.</p>
<h2><a name="planning" class="anchor" href="#planning"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Planning</h2>
<p>When everything is ready, it&#39;s good to prepare a detailed plan. That will help on the day of your meetup to make sure speakers or Q&amp;A sessions don&#39;t overrun. It&#39;s also good to start on time specially if you&#39;re live streaming the event. That said, you must also keep in mind that some attendees may be late so allow a few minutes for everybody to show up before starting.</p>
<h2><a name="promotion" class="anchor" href="#promotion"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Promotion</h2>
<p>To advertise your meetup is critical to its success. Make sure your communicate it on social media and ask, for example, your speakers to help with spreading the word.</p>
<p>After your event it&#39;s also nice to engage with your participants and send a feedback form to help you make the next edition even better!</p>
<h2><a name="organisation" class="anchor" href="#organisation"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Organisation</h2>
<p>The big day has arrived! Make sure there is at least another person to help with the organisation. You&#39;ll be busy making sure everything is ready and the attendees are feeling welcome. Some support from someone who is up to date with the organisation will provide invaluable help.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it! Many other aspects such as using <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>, writing a good code of conduct or charging for attendance are not covered in this guide to keep it quick and easy. I hope the points above will decide you to get started with organising your very own meetup. Feel free to leave a comment below if you have more specific questions.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Media capture, object detection and WebGL can be combined to hack a simple augmented reality experience. See my demo called <a href="https://gmarty.github.io/all-saints-ar/">we are all Saints</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To simplify things, augmented reality is based mainly on 2 technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors to track the position and orientation of the user field of view (FOV)</li>
<li>Computer vision to detect objects in the user FOV</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course modern AR headsets like Hololens combine both to create the best experience possible. I explored using common devices with web technologies to create a simple AR experience. I decided to go for computer vision applied to media capture.</p>

<h2><a name="object-detection" class="anchor" href="#object-detection"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Object detection</h2>
<p>There are few different libraries to detect objects in an image. Most of them seem to be based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV">OpenCV</a>, ported to JavaScript via emscripten.
I didn&#39;t spend too much time looking for a library and quickly settled for <a href="https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect">js-objectdetect</a>. It&#39;s hand-written (as opposed to converted via emscripten) so it makes easy to read, understand and debug if needed. It can detect different types of objects but I used human faces here.</p>
<p>Once set up properly, <code>js-objectdetect</code> accepts a video element as an input, so I just pass to it the one that displays the camera feed I got from <code>getUserMedia</code>.</p>
<p>It return the coordinates in pixel of the faces detected (left, top, width and height).</p>
<h2><a name="recreating-a-virtual-3d-space" class="anchor" href="#recreating-a-virtual-3d-space"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Recreating a virtual 3D space</h2>
<p>Next step is to place the faces detected in the image in a virtual 3D space by estimating their respective positions. I used A-Frame to create the 3D world because this framework is easy to use.</p>
<p>Positioning an element on the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes is really easy. We need to convert the position in the (-1, 1) range, more about that later. For example a point centred in the image will have both its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values set to <code>0</code>. Knowing the position in pixels and the size of the video the values are easy to get (Also the <code>y</code> axis direction is reverse in the web and WebGL). For the <code>x</code> axis, half the width needs to be added so that the element is horizontally centred on the face.</p>
<p>The <code>z</code> axis is a bit trickier. It needs to get estimated and calibrated. I used the height value. I noticed that once detected my face takes at most 80% of the image height when I stand at about 50cm from the camera. The further I step back, say about 2m, the smaller my face gets, to take about 30% of the screen height.</p>
<p>I used these distances as the values for the camera frustum near and far clipping planes (<code>near</code> and <code>far</code> attributes on the <code>&lt;a-camera&gt;</code> element).</p>
<p>Then I only need to convert and clamp the height of the face detected between the % values of image height that I determined above. Once converted to the (-1, 1) range, they&#39;ll vary proportionally between 50cm and 2m. That gives me a good enough approximation of where my face is located in respect to the camera.</p>
<p>I also used the detected height to position the virtual element a few apparent centimetres on top the faces.</p>
<h2><a name="overlaying" class="anchor" href="#overlaying"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Overlaying</h2>
<p> A-Frame uses Three.js under the hood. That&#39;s what I&#39;m using to perform computations.</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve got the x, y and z position in the (-1, 1) range I need to unproject this vector along the active camera. That is not as complicated as it sounds:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">pos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">THREE</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Vector3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">unproject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">camera</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>This returns a vector corresponding to the position in space of the object given the current FOV (i.e. camera).</p>
<p>Finally I can set the position of the A-Frame element in the virtual space that I want to super impose over faces:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;position&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">pos</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This experiment wasn&#39;t as hard as it sounded at first and the result is quite convincing. I learnt a lot about projection and unprojection in the process. As usual the code is on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/gmarty/all-saints-ar">all-saints-ar</a> because we are all saints!</p>
</div><div class="comments"><a href="/posts/augmented-reality-computer-vision/#comments"><span class="icon-bubbles"></span>Comments</a></div><div class="post-head group"><a href="/posts/experimenting-with-vr/"><h1 class="post-title">Experimenting with VR</h1></a><span class="post-date">2016/12/07</span><span class="post-reading-time"></span></div><div class="post-body markdown"><p>I just finished a short series of <a href="https://gmarty.github.io/VR-diary/">experimentations about virtual reality called VR Diary</a>. Here&#39;s a brief summary of why and how.</p>
<h2><a name="vr-but-what-for" class="anchor" href="#vr-but-what-for"><span class="header-link"></span></a>VR, but what for?</h2>
<p>Creating content for virtual reality is easy. <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> is probably the easiest way to get started. It&#39;s entirely free and open-source and only requires a basic of HTML programming. On other projects, I used <a href="https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/">Google VR SDK for Unity</a> and the graphic UI of Unity allows you to create content without even typing a single line of code.</p>
<p>So now the real question is what are we going to use VR for? VR is just a medium and in itself has no value.</p>
<p>This is what I explored in this project. VR is an immersive and engaging platform so I decided to use it to share personal experiences with the readers.</p>
<p>It took a direction towards philosophical questioning and reality challenging that I hadn&#39;t expected. But overall it&#39;s been successful from a personal standpoint: the experiments are consistent (except maybe the first one) and I&#39;ve been able to go through the 6 days.</p>
<h2><a name="working-as-a-hobby" class="anchor" href="#working-as-a-hobby"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Working as a hobby</h2>
<p>An essential aspect to this experiment is being on holiday with a lot of free time. I dedicated about 2 or 3 hours a day actively working on the VR experiment and writing the post. The rest of the day was spent thinking passively about what to do next.</p>
<p>This liberty was essential to generate new ideas to experiment. Creative people know you can&#39;t just sit at a desk and expect to get new ideas. That&#39;s when you go out for a walk, sit in the grass, spend some time in a zoo or a museum that you release the most of your creative potential.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy this lifestyle of working actively a few hours in the morning and passively for the rest of the day. Maybe that&#39;s how life should be: dedicating most of your time to creativity and self-expression and work only for how long is necessary. This is something I want to explore more in the future.</p>

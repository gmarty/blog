<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You can build a voice assistant in JavaScript with existing open source libraries but the result sucks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last couple of days, I explored the voice in the browser. Here are my findings.</p>
<h2><a name="whats-available" class="anchor" href="#whats-available"><span class="header-link"></span></a>What&#39;s available</h2>
<p>Most of the voice related libraries in  JavaScript that I found are simple wrappers around the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html">Web Speech API</a>. Under the hood browsers use external services so I ruled out these libraries immediately as I wanted something that works offline.</p>
<p>What I found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js">pocketsphinx.js</a> for voice recognition</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/speak.js/">speak.js</a> for voice synthesis (several forks available)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these projects are brought to the web thanks to Emscripten and asm.js.</p>
<h2><a name="building-a-not-so-intelligent-voice-assistant" class="anchor" href="#building-a-not-so-intelligent-voice-assistant"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Building a (not so) intelligent voice assistant</h2>
<p>Thanks to a discussion with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/oncletom">Thomas</a> this weekend, <a href="http://cenode.io/">CENode.js</a> was brought to my attention. It&#39;s an open source project to enable human-machine conversation based on a human-friendly format. It can be used to simulate intelligence.</p>
<p>I had all the elements at hand to build a browser-based, offline voice assistant (Think Siri, OK Google, Amazon Echo...).</p>
<h2><a name="coding-or-rather-gluing" class="anchor" href="#coding-or-rather-gluing"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Coding (or rather gluing)</h2>
<p>Gluing all parts together was unsurprisingly easy. Pocketsphinx.js calls a function when the web worker has a final hypothesis:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onmessage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hyp</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">final</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">gotHypothesis</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">evt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hyp</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>I can feed this hypothesis to CENode.js by creating a new card:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">gotHypothesis</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hypothesis</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">card</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;there is a nl card named &#39;{uid}&#39; that is to the agent &#39;agent1&#39; and is from the individual &#39;User&#39; and has the timestamp &#39;{now}&#39; as timestamp and has &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">hypothesis</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/&#39;/g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\\&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39; as content.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">node</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add_sentence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">card</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Then I just have to wait until the deck is polled for new cards to my attention (my name is <code>User</code>). The new card contains the answer to my request and I can just do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">card</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>speak</code> will call <code>espeak.synth()</code> of speak.js.</p>
<h2><a name="adding-a-grammar" class="anchor" href="#adding-a-grammar"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Adding a grammar</h2>
<p>This is it for the JavaScript code. But an important part is still missing. Pocketsphinx.js needs to be fed with a grammar and the pronunciation of all the words used in the grammar. This is used to reduce the scope of detected phrases. So I&#39;ll conveniently reuse all the possible requests supported by CENode.js.</p>
<p>Considering the <a href="http://cenode.io/demo/">CENode.js demo</a> about astronomy, here&#39;s a list of some requests that it can understand (let me know if I missed any):</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">orbits</span> <span class="nx">Mars</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">does</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">Saturn</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">star</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">List</span> <span class="nx">instances</span> <span class="nx">of</span> <span class="nx">type</span> <span class="nx">planet</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The first step is to compute all the possible permutations that make sense in English and that CENode.js will understand. I found 124 of them. This is the corpus I&#39;ll use in the next steps.</p>
<p>The grammar used by pocketsphinx.js is a Finite State Grammar. Think of a finite state machine where each state adds a word to the phrase:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="c1">// s is the state with initial value 0.</span>

<span class="p">[]</span>    <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">What</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">does</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">Titan</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>    <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>     <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>     <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>      <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The grammar for this simple phrase is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">grammar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">numStates</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The more phrases you add, the more complex it gets. For each state, pocketsphinx.js uses the grammar to figure out what is a possible next step. If your grammar is correct, you cannot end up with meaningless sentences.</p>
<p>I wrote a small script to build grammars from a corpus of phrases that I may publish if anyone is interested.</p>
<h2><a name="adding-pronunciation" class="anchor" href="#adding-pronunciation"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Adding pronunciation</h2>
<p>For each word in the corpus, pocketsphinx.js needs to know how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>I fed my corpus to <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html">Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool</a>. I simply took the <code>*.dic</code> file from the gz archive, split it on line breaks and split again each line on tabs and I got something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">const</span> <span class="nx">wordList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;WHAT&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;W AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;WHAT(2)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;HH W AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;ORBIT&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;AO R B AH T&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;MARS&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;M AA R Z&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="the-result" class="anchor" href="#the-result"><span class="header-link"></span></a>The result</h2>
<p>Et voila ! That&#39;s all I needed to get an astronomy centred voice assistant that can tell me what satellites orbit around what planets and other detailed infos. I have to say it&#39;s pretty cool, specially because I&#39;m a big fan of astronomy and I got this project done in under 2 days.</p>
<p>As a side note I tested it only on Firefox Nightly on my laptop. Results may differ on Chrome or on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The result though is not really convincing. First of all pocketsphinx.js voice recognition is bad. I can probably blame it on  my accent (I&#39;m French, remember), but it&#39;s so frustrating to say &quot;What orbits Saturn?&quot; hundreds of time with no results while my colleague got understood at the first try! The good thing at least is it can&#39;t return phrases out of the grammar, so it will always output something that makes sense.</p>
<p>CENode.js is also super limited and I don&#39;t really know how to improve it beyond the example provided (the format is well documented though). Some simple phrases, outside of the understanding scope, fail miserably:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">orbited</span> <span class="nx">by</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span><span class="o">?</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="nx">fails</span>
<span class="nx">What</span> <span class="nx">does</span> <span class="nx">Titan</span> <span class="nx">orbit</span><span class="o">?</span>    <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="nx">succeeds</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>But if you ask &quot;What is Saturn?&quot;, you get:</p>
<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">Saturn</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">planet</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="nx">Saturn</span> <span class="nx">orbits</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">star</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sun&#39;</span> <span class="nx">and</span> <span class="nx">is</span> <span class="nx">orbited</span> <span class="nx">by</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">moon</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Titan&#39;</span><span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>The passive voice does not seem to be supported in requests.</p>
<p>Finally, what is output by speak.js is pretty terrifying. Whatever the voice you choose, they all sound robotic. They have a cool retro feeling if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after (and you can argue that it works better for something related to astronomy and space), but they&#39;re far from the quality of commercial products.</p>
<h2><a name="going-further" class="anchor" href="#going-further"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Going further</h2>
<p>This experimentation was limited in time so I didn&#39;t want to spend too much on it, but if I had had a real project to build, I&#39;d had seriously looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding better language packages for pocketsphinx.js.</li>
<li>Building better grammar files for pocketsphinx.js.</li>
<li>Using CENode.js&#39; advanced features.</li>
<li>Using better voice packages in espeak.js.</li>
<li>Supporting more languages outside of English</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth sharing the code that&#39;s messy and I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader, unless somebody is really interested.</p>
<p>What I can share though is the FSG generator from a corpus. It needs some cleaning but the code can run on node or in the browser.</p>
<p>There&#39;s probably tons of mistakes and approximations in this post, I&#39;m by no means a voice expert, so please correct me if need be. Also if you have any ideas on how to improve it or if I missed an existing library, please do let me know in the comments. Thanks!</p>

As a test case, I generated a Welsh keyboard, as it is one of the few languages I know a little that didn&#39;t have a keyboard in Firefox OS (<a href="http://gu.illau.me/posts/japanese-keyboard-for-firefox-os/">Japanese keyboard</a> is another exception though). Typing on a mobile is hard enough, so word suggestions and autocorrect are keys for a better experience.
If you speak Welsh, even a little, and use Firefox OS on the master branch, please help us to test the keyboard and assess its quality.</p>
<h2><a name="install-and-activate-the-welsh-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#install-and-activate-the-welsh-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Install and activate the Welsh keyboard</h2>
<p>Make sure you are using the latest version of B2G. If your device is a Flame or a Sony Z3C running Firefox OS, then you should get new updates automatically. Otherwise, you&#39;ll want to flash the latest version.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick demo of how to install it on your device.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWlPnWrX7AE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2><a name="test-the-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#test-the-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Test the keyboard</h2>
<p>The dictionary builtin in the keyboard is based on <a href="https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafan">Wikipedia in Welsh</a>, which has, I believe, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">decent number of pages</a> (around 64,000 articles, ranking it 64th biggest language out of 290).</p>
<p>From my experience, the results is very satisfying. I found the words suggested by this keyboard very useful. But my knowledge of Welsh is very limited, so it may not be completely helpful to a fluent speaker (or writer rather). In particular, I&#39;m afraid that it may be too formal or lack slang or colloquial expressions, frequently used in SMS or social networks.</p>
<h2><a name="we-need-you" class="anchor" href="#we-need-you"><span class="header-link"></span></a>We need you!</h2>
<p>If you speak Welsh, please, try it for yourself. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback and if you have any comments, please use the field below, or reach me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/g_marty">@g_marty</a>. If this method is proved to give good results, I&#39;d love to give it a go at producing dictionary in more languages.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> You can&#39;t efficiently type in Japanese on a Firefox OS device, unless you buy a fx0 device or you build Gaia yourself and are very patient!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firefox OS is targeting a global audience. You can set your interface in 90 different languages and there are over 70 language specific keyboards!
But developing a keyboard is more challenging for some languages than others and Japanese is one of them.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t give much details about why is a Japanese IME hard to implement, but the main reason is that there is a massive amount of  suggestions that need to be stored on the device somehow. In Japanese, any word can be usually written in several different ways. Storing such a dictionary can cause serious issues on low-end devices with limited memory and processing power.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not a reason to just giving up typing in Japanese on Firefox OS.</p>
<h2><a name="fx0" class="anchor" href="#fx0"><span class="header-link"></span></a>fx0</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, KDDI released the <a href="http://au-fx.kddi.com/products/">fx0</a>, a Firefox OS powered device, on the Japanese market. This phone comes with a Japanese keyboard called <a href="http://www.omronsoft.co.jp/product_text/iwnn-ime-for-firefox-os/">iWnn IME</a> and developed by Omron Software.</p>
<p>The implementation is efficient and powerful. It comes with many options to configure the keyboard to perfectly suit your needs and habits. Such a high quality is not really surprising as the same keyboard is already available on other platforms (Android notably).</p>
<p>This keyboard has been open sourced in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-japan/iwnn-ime-sample">iwnn-ime-sample</a> Github repo. However the licence is expiring on 30th September 2015 (not sure what&#39;s happening afterwards).</p>
<p>The readme file claims it&#39;s possible to flash it on a Flame running Firefox OS v2.0. So I tried and everything is working, except for the core feature: the words suggestion. To achieve this in an optimised way, a local server running on the device is used to query words. This part doesn&#39;t work. The keyboard however can still be used to input kana, but you won&#39;t get any word suggestions.</p>
<p>I then flashed it on a master (tried both on a Flame and Sony Z3C). I encountered the same issue with the words suggestion together with other few minor bugs. But if you use it as a kana only keyboard, then this is probably acceptable.</p>
<p>Drop me a comment below if you need help on how to install it.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LdqNqF5ny4xMumE8m9jSZQMrujhFDIGZBA1SUoxYAU0u=s0" alt="iWnn IME for Firefox OS" title="iWnn IME for Firefox OS"></p>
<h2><a name="gaia-jp-kanji-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#gaia-jp-kanji-keyboard"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Gaia <code>jp-kanji</code> keyboard</h2>
<p>There is already a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/keyboard/js/imes/jskanji">Japanese keyboard in Gaia</a>. To install it, you must build Gaia yourself and flash your device. Here is the suggested command line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ GAIA_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS</span><span class="o">=</span>en,jp-kanji make reset-gaia
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>Once flashed, you must enable the new keyboard in <code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>Keyboards</code>  &gt; <code>Select keyboards</code>.</p>
<p>This IME comes with words suggestion, but it is neither as user-friendly nor as fast as the iWnn IME one.
That is the reason why it is not available to current builds. I love how the design fits in the Firefox OS UI though.</p>
<p>There are plans to build a better Japanese keyboard for Firefox OS, but nothing has happened yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HZ53_An9tjhWPoveJ4XCbOLdQ-DKCwOxY1hTrcneicTH=s0" alt="Gaia jp-kanji Keyboard" title="Gaia jp-kanji Keyboard"></p>
<p>So unfortunately, there is no easy way to install a Japanese keyboard on Firefox OS, but we&#39;re working on it!
If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m doing with my device, I use the iWnn IME keyboard, but because of its limitations, I avoid typing in Japanese on my mobile whenever I can :-)</p>

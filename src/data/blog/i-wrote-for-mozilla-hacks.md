## Achievement unlocked!

I'm excited to announce that I've written an article about [video game emulation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/10/fast-retro-gaming-on-mobile/) for Mozilla Hacks. While that doesn't sound like a big deal, it actually means a lot to me.

I remember the first day this blog was launched. Since then it has always been a pleasure to read new publications. I think I must have read every single article so far. I love it when a new article is posted because it means an aspect of the web platform will be explained in details.

[Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/) and [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/) are my favourite resources online, both technical and inspirational. Whenever I'm notified of a new post on these, that usually means stop what I'm doing and read it right away!

## Writing about retro gaming

Just a note about the [blogpost](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/10/fast-retro-gaming-on-mobile/). It's basically an expanded version of the talk I gave earlier last month at Reject.JS about fast retro gaming on mobile. I tried to be clear and assumed as little knowledge as possible from the reader.

The writing process was surprisingly easy. I'm working for almost a decade as a freelance writer for texts published in the French edition of some Japanese manga titles. I'm used to have my texts edited/modified/transformed without my consent. Nothing here. The original draft I submitted was almost published as is.

Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy reading it!

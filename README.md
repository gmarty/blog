- Stretched links on post cards in lists.
- Change the titles font.
- Refactor apps and talks pages to use the same code.
- For post titles, try to use the cover image as a dimmed background for the title.
- Restore the estimated reading time feature.
- Implement a service worker strategy.
- Use local avatar instead of gravatar.

## Internationalization

This template has support for i18n, it's set up for English as default. You can add more languages in the `src/i18n/ui.ts` file. It doesn't have support for dynamic language change, but it's easy to implement.

## Extend / Customize

`src/consts.ts` contains a list of constants that you can customize to your liking, including the blog title, description, author, social media links, etc.

`src/functions.ts` contains a list of functions that changes the default behavior of the template, including default post sorting and exclude draft posts.

`src/content/authors/default.mdx` contains the default author information. You can add more authors by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/authors` folder.

`src/content/tags/default.mdx` contains the default tag information. You can add more tags by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/tags` folder.

`src/content/config.ts` contains all fields for author, blog and tags pages. Check what's required and what's not. You can also add more fields if you want to.
